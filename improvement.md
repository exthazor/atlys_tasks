## General Codebase Improvements

1. *Unified Error Handling*: Develop a unified error handling strategy across the application, including centralized logging and consistent error responses with status code.
2. *Secure Environment Configuration*: Store all sensitive configurations such as JWT secrets, database credentials and all hardcoded values in environment variables. 
3. *Types*: Advantage of using typescript is to find issues at compile time. Consider adding more types to variables.
4. *Enhanced Asynchronous Operations*: Transition to asynchronous operations for intensive tasks such as bcrypt password hashing to enhance system responsiveness and scalability.
5. *Structured Logging and Monitoring*: Implement structured logging to provide clear, actionable insights into application behavior, aiding in faster troubleshooting and operational monitoring. Console.log needs to be replaced.
6. *Comprehensive Testing Framework*: Expand testing to cover all critical functionalities.

## Methodwise Codebase Improvements

1. `generateUsers`: Switch to asynchronous bcrypt hashing (bcrypt.hash) to enhance performance by not blocking the event loop during user generation.
2. `generateFollows`: Optimize the random selection process by utilizing database capabilities. 
3. `getRandomDateInPast`: Cache the result of Date.now() outside the loop to avoid recalculating the current timestamp.
4. `generatePosts`:`Implement batch processing in prisma.post.createMany to handle large data sets.
5. **all the controllers**: Precompile schemas with AJV for data validation at compile time rather than run-time.
6. `withStaleWhileRevalidate`: Incorporate error handling to manage and log failures during cache retrieval. Also needs to be rewritten to handle cases where multiple simultaneous requests cause redundant revalidations.
7. `authRequiredHook`: Need to incorporate token expiry logic. Can add refresh tokens for enhanced security.
8. `config.ts`: Use import instead of require.
